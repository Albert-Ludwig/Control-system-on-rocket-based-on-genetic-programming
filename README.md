| Finished in McMaster University, Data Structure and Analysis.

•	Evolutionary Control Algorithm: Developed a high-performance simulation in C++ utilizing Genetic Programming (GP); engineered the system to autonomously evolve control strategies that stabilize the rocket around a target setpoint without pre-defined control laws.

•	Kinematic Optimization: Implemented fitness functions based on real-time kinematic data (position and velocity) to drive the selection, crossover, and mutation processes, successfully achieving stable hovering behavior through iterative optimization.

•	State Estimation & Inference: Designed a temporal memory mechanism to handle scenarios of partial observability (position-only input); enabled the algorithm to infer velocity vectors from historical trajectory data, maintaining control stability under constrained sensor conditions.
